#Abstract


#Introduction
Everything around us has changed since the digital revolution. The digital era has transformed how people live their lives, how they interact with one another and how they learn and gather new information. There is no doubt that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have had a monumental impact on the world in which we live, fundamentally changing the way individuals communicate, entertain and learn. With the increase accessibility to ICTs and the existing state of mobility between people around the world, it is easy to envision an existing relationship between increased access to communication and information and the results of migration. 




#A Theoretical Perspective
Migration is broadly defined as a permanent or semi-permanent relocation of residence, there are no restrictions placed upon the distance or voluntary or involuntary nature of moving. Migration is one of the three main determinants of a country???s population development (Lee, 1966). Every act of migration involves an origin, a destination and intervening set of obstacles and opportunities. The idea of human mobility is that individuals are always in constant circulation. Humans are constantly moving throughout their lives, which could be seen on varying degrees. Whether it is a college student returning home every summer, or a family permanently moving to another country. In existing literature, the factors that influence an individual???s decision to migrant are multifold and are described as a combination of social, ethnic, and politically related factors that can be categorized as either Push or Pull factors.
