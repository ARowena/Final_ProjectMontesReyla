## Motivation & Research Question 

*Computer mediated communication has created new possibilities for migrants to maintain strong linkages and ties with their home nations (Hiller, 2004)*

1. We are interested in analysing the historical development of ICTs and its impact on migration

2. 


**Research Questions: Has the increase use of technologies, such as the Internet and mobile phones affected the flows of emigration?**


## Theoretical Framework - Push Factors

## Methodology

**Model 1: Cellphone Users**
$$ I_\frac{Migration}{Pop{total}} = {\beta}_0 +{\beta}_1 Cell + {\beta}_2 FertRate + {\beta}_3 PoliStab + {\beta}_4 EmployProb + {\epsilon}_{it}$$

**Model 2: Internet Users**
$$ I_\frac{Migration}{Pop{total}} = {\beta}_0 +{\beta}_1 Net + {\beta}_2 FertRate + {\beta}_3 PoliStab + {\beta}_4 EmployProb + {\epsilon}_{it}$$


**Datasets:** 

- UN Migration Stock 1990-2013 and World Bank Indicators 


**Methodology:**

- Panel regression with fixed effects
