## Motivation & Research Question 

*Computer mediated communication has created new possibilities for migrants to maintain strong linkages and ties with their home nations (Hiller, 2004)*

1. We are interested in analysing the historical development of ICTs and its impact on migration



**Research Questions: Has the increase use of technologies, such as the Internet and mobile phones affected the flows of emigration?**


## Theoretical Framework - Push Factors

## Theoretical Framework - Pull Factors

![Figure2](http://i67.tinypic.com/5vmwrm.jpg) 


## Methodology

**Model 1: Cellphone Users**
$$ I_\frac{Migration}{Pop{total}} = {\beta}_0 +{\beta}_1 Cell + {\beta}_2 FertRate + {\beta}_3 PoliStab + {\beta}_4 EmployProb + {\epsilon}_{it}$$

**Model 2: Internet Users**
$$ I_\frac{Migration}{Pop{total}} = {\beta}_0 +{\beta}_1 Net + {\beta}_2 FertRate + {\beta}_3 PoliStab + {\beta}_4 EmployProb + {\epsilon}_{it}$$


**Datasets:** 

- UN Migration Stock 1990-2013 and World Bank Indicators 


**Methodology:**

- Panel regression with fixed effects

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
