Thank you for showing interest in our research project! 

Our names are Ana M. and Ayra R. and together we are conducting a brief study on the the factors that influence migration. Particularly, this research explores how changes in the 20th century have  changed the flows of migration. We are trying to answer the following question: **Has Information, communication and technology (ICT) impact the flow of migration?**

#**WHY ARE WE STUDYING ICT AND MIGRATION?**

Migration is broadly defined as a permanent or semi-permanent relocation of residence, there are no restrictions placed upon the distance or voluntary or involuntary nature of moving [@Lee1966]. For many years, the idea of international migration meant disconnecting with one's homeland. This meant the process of communication with friends and family left behind was a slow process, often via hand written letters. However, since the dawn the digital age at the start of the 20th century information and communication technology 2(ICT) has radically changed the speed and nature of interactions between people worldwide. 

ICT and the emergence of globalisation has impacted every facet of our daily lives, we want to observe if it has affected the why people move and why people stay. 


#**PUSH AND PULLS**

- Push factors are reasons that are generally forced and negative, these factors are associated with the country of origin. 
- People are 'pushed' to leave their homeland for a number of varying reasons.

- Pull factors on the other hand are the positive traits that positively affect the movement of people. Often people are drawn to move to places to escape the negative factors pushing them out.



#**THE DATA**



In order to examine the flows of migration, this analysis uses data from the International Migrant Stock produced by the United Nations. The data contains information from 232 countries and provides the number of migrants by destination and country of origin for four periods of time; 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2013. Moreover, to account for technology diffusion we will use World Bank indicators on the number of Internet users and the number of cellular mobile subscriptions for each country.

The International Migrant Stock Total indicates the number of people born in a country other than the country in which they currently reside in, this includes refugees as well. The data set estimates the international migrant stock at a particular time and are mainly collect from population censuses. Also, the data set presents the estimates of : (1) international migrant stock at mid-year; (2) total population at mid-year (thousands); (3) international migrant stock as a percentage of the total population; (4) annual rate of change of migrant stock (percentage); and (5) estimated number of refugees. The estimates are based on official statistics on the foreign-born or the foreign population.

This analysis will focus on the estimates for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2013.

Additionally, in order to conduct a more thorough analysis we will include a number of aggregate data collected from The World Bank indicators. There are many other determinants of migration, that is why this analysis chooses to include a wide variety of World Bank indicators. The chosen indicators are used to measure certain push factors.

To measure economic and demographic determinants this analysis includes the fertility rate indicator. Indicators such as poverty and unemployment have been removed from the analysis, as there are many missing values in the data set.
